//        (distance player/mob < 3), otherwise mobs may change target and chase 
//        ranged attackers. This flag also overrides the 'provoke' target.
// 0x008: When set, mobs scatter as soon as they lose their target. Use this mode
//        to make it much harder to mob-train by hiding and collecting them on a
//        single spot (ie: GrimTooth training)

//        on six lines in the mob_skill_db, only the entry that is actually used
